# Welcome to Sorrry! Replay.
Due to the fickle nature of Vuforia not running on anything that isn't an app and the extral levels of difficulty/money needed to add them to the app store. We have created a simple guide on how to use this application

/-/-/ If you do not have a gameboard there is an image provided /-/-/

Currently we have two way's to run the application.
   1. For Android Users
   2. For PC Users

# For Android Users
This was the target device we picked when working on this app. Attached in this GitHub is an APK file, simply: 
   1. Enable installing apps from unknown sources by holding on the web browser app icon -> app info -> advanced settings -> install unknown apps -> toggle to on
   2. Download the APK file of the app on your android device
   3. Install the app by running the APK file from a file manager.

# For PC Users
You can use Vuforia via testing inside unity itself, so if you want to play around with the concept or just try out the game download this repository and try it out for yourself.
